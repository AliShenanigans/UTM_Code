# UTM_Code

hi!
go to runSim and hit run...
it imports a bunch of functions that live in functions.py
you only need those 2 scripts


the results are pretty meaningless for now because all the data is
randomly generated...which is surpisingly fair!
if you want graphs unhash lines 358, 397 and 442 =)
